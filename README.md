# C#-Basics

- `.Net` framework has two components,

  1. CLR - Common Language Runtime.
  2. Class Library.

- `C` or `C++` code is compiled into machine code which is language dependent. That means when we compile it a particular machine, it won't run in any machine with different OS or config. To overcome this, `C#` borrowed concepts from `Java`. In Java, the code is coverted into bytecodes then the `JVM` runs it. Similarly in C#, the code is converted into `**IL Code**` which is machine independent. Then we use `CLR` to run it. CLR is sitting in the memory and translating the IL Code. This process is called `Just in Time Compilation` aka `JIT`.
